# The assumptions made:
## For Q1

2. The Folder Assignment will be made in the folder in which the user is currently at irrespective of the path of the input file or the
executable file.
3. The file name should be no longer than 50 charcters long.
4. If the program can't close the file it will only show the error but the return value will be `0` (success).
5. input file named `./Assignment/<filename>` will not be passed as argument as it would result in an empty file creation.
